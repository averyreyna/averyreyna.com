CoupCast is an innovative early warning system I maintained with Jonathan Powell and Clayton Besaw that uses machine learning to forecast the risk of coups worldwide. The project transforms our understanding of political risk assessment by leveraging advanced random forest models to analyze historical patterns and identify key risk factors contributing to political instability.

At its core, CoupCast functions as a political weather forecast. Just as meteorologists combine historical weather patterns with current conditions to predict tomorrow's weather, CoupCast combines decades of political data with current situations to forecast potential instability. The system generates monthly estimates of coup risk for every country worldwide, analyzing long-term structural conditions and immediate triggers that might spark a coup.

## The REIGN Dataset

The Rulers, Elections, and Irregular Governance (REIGN) dataset forms the backbone of CoupCast's predictive capabilities. This comprehensive database tracks political conditions in every country every month, covering 201 sovereign states. The dataset includes every current member of the United Nations, including small island microstates, but excludes non-sovereign entities like Vatican City, Greenland, and Puerto Rico. The temporal coverage extends from January 1950 to the present, though many states enter the dataset only after achieving independence.

REIGN has compiled detailed information on more than 2,300 world leaders who governed a qualifying country for at least seven consecutive days between January 1950 and the present. The dataset defines qualifying leaders as the recognized head of government, which is typically the president, prime minister, monarch, acting/interim head, or junta chairman. San Marino represents the only exception to the single-leader rule, with its unique system of two Captains Regent sharing equal power.

### Leader Data

For each leader, REIGN tracks four critical pieces of information:

1. **Age**: Calculated as the difference between the year of observation and birth year. This calculation method means leaders may be listed as one year older for months before their birth month.
2. **Gender**: As of September 2016, approximately 96.5% of leaders were male, and 3.5% were female.
3. **Military Career**: Leaders are coded based on whether their primary route to power is through a military or police career. This coding distinguishes between those who merely served in the military (like George H. W. Bush) and those who rose to power from high-ranking military positions (like Dwight D. Eisenhower). Approximately 16% of leaders emerged from military or police positions.
4. **Election Month**: Records the month in which a popular election for their office first legitimized each leader's tenure. About 49% of leaders were elected at some point before or during their tenure.

### Election Data

The election component of REIGN provides detailed information about election schedules and outcomes for all elections related to leader selection or power. Each election is assigned a unique identifier and tracked across multiple dimensions:

1. **Announcement**: Records when elections were announced within six months of the planned date
2. **Delays**: Tracks major postponements (more than two weeks)
3. **Deadlines**: Monitors constitutional deadlines for irregular elections
4. **Regularity**: Indicates whether the election follows an established pattern
5. **Victory**: Notes whether the incumbent or their chosen successor maintained power
6. **Change**: Records whether the election resulted in leadership change
7. **Run-off Status**: Distinguishes between single-round and multi-round elections

### Election Classification System

REIGN employs a sophisticated decision tree to categorize political events that could affect leadership or executive power. The classification system first distinguishes between referendums and contests for office, then follows a detailed branching logic to categorize each event appropriately. This systematic approach ensures consistent classification across different political systems and contexts. Five main categories emerge from this classification system:

1. **Direct Executive Elections**: Where the population directly elects an individual leader, as in typical presidential systems
2. **Direct Legislative Elections**: Often called general elections, where the population elects a legislature from which executive leadership emerges
3. **Indirect Executive Elections**: Where a recently elected legislature selects an executive
4. **Appointment by Elites**: Where unelected or previously elected elites select the executive
5. **Direct Referendums**: Public votes on significant changes to executive authority

This classification structure, visualized in the decision tree below, allows REIGN to treat similar political events across different systems and periods consistently. The system is particularly valuable for analyzing transitional periods and complex political arrangements where the nature of leadership selection might be ambiguous.

## Statistical Methodology and Model Implementation

The statistical engine employs a rolling estimation strategy where yearly predictions are produced using only data up to the previous year. For example, 1976 predictions use data from 1950-1975, while 1977 predictions incorporate data through 1976. This approach ensures all estimates are truly out-of-sample, preventing overstatement of the model's predictive power. Recent observations are weighted more heavily than those from previous years to account for evolving patterns in political instability.

The complementary log-log function is critical to the model's success. Unlike traditional logit models, which are symmetric around the midpoint, the complementary log-log function provides an asymmetric curve that better handles the extreme rarity of coup events. This asymmetry allows the model to assign very low probabilities to a much wider range of observations while maintaining sensitivity to high-risk scenarios.

### Variable Processing and Integration

CoupCast employs sophisticated data processing techniques to handle multiple types of predictor variables. The system uses linear and non-linear transformations for continuous variables like economic indicators to capture complex relationships. GDP data, for instance, undergoes logarithmic transformation to account for diminishing marginal effects, while population data is modeled with linear and squared terms to capture curvilinear relationships.

### Regional Contagion Modeling

The system models regional coup contagion through a population-weighted approach. Each country's regional coup risk score is calculated by summing the weighted coup history scores of other countries in the region, with weights determined by logged population values. This approach ensures that instability in larger states has a proportionally more significant impact on regional risk assessments. The region's total logged population then normalizes the regional score to enable cross-regional comparisons.

### Economic and Social Indicator Integration

Economic and social indicators are processed through a multiple imputation framework that combines data from the World Bank and various other sources. For GDP data, the system uses the following imputation model:

## CoupCast's Predictions in Mali

The predictive power of CoupCast was particularly evident in our analysis of Mali during 2021-2022. The system identified Mali as having the second-highest coup risk globally, behind only Sudan. This assessment wasn't merely theoretical, but based on a complex web of interconnected factors that the system identified and analyzed.

Mali's elevated risk stemmed from multiple sources. The country had experienced approximately eight coup attempts since gaining independence in 1960, creating a historical pattern that the system recognized as significant. Additionally, Mali had been grappling with a decade-long jihadist insurgency, which had created persistent security challenges and political instability. The economic situation further complicated matters. Mali was experiencing stagnating per capita GDP, growing inflationary pressures, and a worsening hunger crisis. These financial challenges were compounded by the global impacts of COVID-19 and surging food prices due to international conflicts.

Perhaps most notably, CoupCast showed particular sensitivity to electoral timing in Mali. The system's risk assessments peaked around scheduled election dates—a pattern that proved prescient when successive coups subsequently voided these elections. After President Ibrahim Keïta's downfall in August 2020, the coupists announced a two-year transition, voiding the original October 2021 election. The May 2021 coup then reset the transitional process, voiding the election scheduled for February 2022.

## Civilian-Military Dynamics

While CoupCast's statistical engine primarily focuses on structural indicators and historical patterns, some research I conducted in tandem with this project has highlighted the crucial role of civilian actors in coup dynamics. Our analysis shows that incorporating civilian collaboration patterns could enhance the model's predictive capabilities, particularly in cases where traditional coup risk indicators may not fully capture the complexity of political instability.
