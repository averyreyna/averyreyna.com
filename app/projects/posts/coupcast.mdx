CoupCast is a groundbreaking machine learning system that forecasts coup attempts worldwide by combining decades of historical political data with current conditions to generate monthly risk estimates for every country. Developed and maintained in collaboration with Jonathan Powell and Clayton Besaw, the project's significance is demonstrated by its remarkable predictive accuracy, with one-third of all coups occurring in countries within the top 5% of forecasted coup risk, making it an invaluable tool for understanding and anticipating political upheaval.

## Research Context
Political stability forecasting has traditionally relied on qualitative expert assessments or simple statistical models that often fail to capture the complex interplay of factors leading to political instability. These approaches typically struggle to account for the extreme rarity of coup events, regional contagion effects, and the intricate relationship between structural conditions and immediate triggers. Without more sophisticated predictive tools, policymakers and analysts lack reliable early warning systems for anticipating political crises.

The REIGN (Rulers, Elections, and Irregular Governance) dataset addresses these limitations by providing comprehensive political data covering 201 sovereign states from 1950 to the present, tracking detailed information on more than 2,300 world leaders. By combining this rich historical data with advanced machine learning techniques, our research fills a critical gap in the field, moving beyond traditional statistical approaches to create a more nuanced and accurate prediction system, as demonstrated by its success in forecasting recent political instability events such as those in Mali.

## Methodology and Design
Our project employs a sophisticated random forest model combined with a complementary log-log function to handle the extreme rarity of coup events. Unlike traditional logit models, which are symmetric around the midpoint, the complementary log-log function provides an asymmetric curve that better assigns very low probabilities to a broader range of observations while maintaining sensitivity to high-risk scenarios. This approach is critical for modeling events that occur in less than 1% of country-months in our dataset.

The implementation process begins with comprehensive data collection through the REIGN dataset, which employs systematic classification of political events using a detailed decision tree. Our model development integrates rolling estimation strategies to ensure truly out-of-sample predictions, population-weighted approaches to model regional coup contagion effects, and linear and non-linear transformations for continuous variables to capture complex relationships. The validation framework encompasses historical validation against known coup attempts, cross-regional comparison methodology, and constant model refinement based on prediction accuracy.

## Research Questions
- How can machine learning techniques be effectively applied to predict coup attempts using historical political data?
- What are the key structural and immediate factors that contribute to increased coup risk, and how do these factors interact?
- How does the relationship between civilian and military actors influence coup probability, and can these dynamics be effectively modeled?
- To what extent can regional coup contagion effects be quantified and incorporated into predictive models?

## Key Findings
Our research has demonstrated exceptional predictive accuracy, with one-third of all coups occurring in countries within the top 5% of risk predictions. Cases above the 99th percentile of risk show an 11-fold higher coup probability than average, while those above the 99.9th percentile exhibit a remarkable 32.8-fold increase in coup likelihood. These findings validate our complementary log-log approach to rare event modeling and confirm the effectiveness of our random forest implementation in capturing the complex interactions between different risk factors.

The research has revealed significant patterns in how military experience affects coup risk across different types of governments, with civilian leaders facing much higher coup risk in military governments, while having a military career background is associated with lower coup risk across both military and civilian regimes. We also validated the importance of electoral timing in coup risk assessment, as demonstrated in our analysis of Mali during from 2021 to 2022, where the country consistently ranked in the highest tier of global risk despite fluctuations in its absolute risk score. This successful prediction of real-world political instability events confirms the practical utility of our approach.

## Design Implications
CoupCast's success demonstrates that machine learning approaches can effectively address the complex challenge of political forecasting when adequately designed to account for the unique characteristics of rare political events. The asymmetric probability distribution provided by the complementary log-log function proves particularly valuable for extreme events forecasting, offering a model for similar applications in other areas of political risk assessment. Our findings suggest that future forecasting systems should emphasize integrating structural conditions and immediate triggers rather than treating them as separate domains of analysis. The demonstrated relationship between civilian-military dynamics and coup risk highlights the need for more nuanced approaches to security sector reform and civil-military relations in high-risk contexts. Rather than focusing exclusively on institutional reforms, policymakers should consider the specific background characteristics of leaders and how they interact with governance structures. The system's ability to process complex political, economic, and social factors makes it an invaluable tool for researchers and security analysts seeking to understand the multifaceted nature of political instability.

## Limitations and Future Work
While our model demonstrates strong predictive power, it is constrained by the quality and comprehensiveness of available data, particularly in regions with limited historical documentation. The current implementation also faces challenges distinguishing between different coup attempts and capturing very short-term triggering events that might occur days or weeks before a coup. A more comprehensive system would benefit from integrating real-time media monitoring and natural language processing to capture rapidly evolving situations.

Future research will expand the system's capabilities by integrating additional data sources, including social media indicators, economic real-time data, and more detailed regional analysis. We aim to develop more sophisticated regional contagion models that better account for cross-border influences, enhance our analysis of civilian-military collaboration patterns, and implement real-time update capabilities. Country-specific risk assessment tools and interactive visualization platforms represent promising directions for making this research more accessible to policymakers and security practitioners who must translate forecasts into preventive action.

## Broader Impact
CoupCast represents a significant advancement in political risk assessment methodology, demonstrating how machine learning techniques can effectively apply to complex social and political phenomena. By providing reliable early warnings of potential political instability, the system enables more proactive and targeted conflict prevention efforts, potentially reducing the human and economic costs of sudden regime changes and political violence. The theoretical framework developed through this research contributes to our understanding of coup dynamics and the interplay between structural vulnerabilities and immediate triggers, advancing scholarship in comparative politics and security studies. Beyond academic contributions, the practical applications of this system have implications for international organizations, diplomatic missions, and development agencies working in high-risk regions. They offer an evidence-based approach to prioritizing stabilization efforts and developing more effective governance interventions. This research ultimately aims to promote political stability as a foundation for sustainable development and human security.
