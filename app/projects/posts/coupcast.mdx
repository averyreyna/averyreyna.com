CoupCast represents a groundbreaking approach to political risk assessment through the application of machine learning techniques to forecast coup attempts worldwide. Developed and maintained in collaboration with Jonathan Powell and Clayton Besaw, this innovative early warning system combines decades of historical political data with current conditions to generate monthly estimates of coup risk for every country worldwide. The project's significance is demonstrated by its remarkable predictive accuracy, with one-third of all coups occurring in countries within the top 5% of forecasted coup risk, making it an invaluable tool for understanding and anticipating political upheaval.

### RESEARCH CONTEXT
## Background
The field of political stability forecasting has traditionally relied on qualitative expert assessments or simple statistical models that often fail to capture the complex interplay of factors leading to political instability. The REIGN (Rulers, Elections, and Irregular Governance) dataset addresses this limitation by providing comprehensive political data covering 201 sovereign states from 1950 to the present, tracking detailed information on more than 2,300 world leaders, including their age, gender, military career background, and election history. This research fills a critical gap in the field by combining this comprehensive historical data with advanced machine learning techniques, moving beyond traditional statistical approaches to create a more nuanced and accurate prediction system, as demonstrated by its success in forecasting recent events such as political instability in Mali.

## Questions
1. How can machine learning techniques be effectively applied to predict coup attempts using historical political data?
2. What are the key structural and immediate factors that contribute to increased coup risk, and how do these factors interact?
3. How does the relationship between civilian and military actors influence coup probability, and can these dynamics be effectively modeled?
4. To what extent can regional coup contagion effects be quantified and incorporated into predictive models?

### METHODOLOGY
## Research Design
The project employs a sophisticated random forest model combined with a complementary log-log function to handle the extreme rarity of coup events. Unlike traditional logit models, which are symmetric around the midpoint, the complementary log-log function provides an asymmetric curve that better handles the extreme rarity of coup events. This asymmetry allows the model to assign very low probabilities to a much wider range of observations while maintaining sensitivity to high-risk scenarios.

The research design incorporates several sophisticated methodological components working in concert. A rolling estimation strategy ensures truly out-of-sample predictions, while a population-weighted approach enables effective modeling of regional coup contagion effects. The system employs both linear and non-linear transformations for continuous variables to capture complex relationships in the data, and all predictions undergo comprehensive validation against historical coup attempts to ensure accuracy and reliability.

## Implementation
The implementation process begins with comprehensive data collection and processing through the REIGN dataset, which tracks over 2,300 world leaders across multiple dimensions and employs systematic classification of political events using a detailed decision tree. The model development phase integrates the complementary log-log function for asymmetric probability distribution, implements a rolling estimation strategy, and incorporates regional contagion calculations using population-weighted approaches. The validation framework encompasses historical validation against known coup attempts, cross-regional comparison methodology, and continuous model refinement based on prediction accuracy. The system employs a sophisticated decision tree for classifying political events, ensuring consistent analysis across different political systems and contexts.

### DISCUSSION
## Data Analysis
The analysis employs multiple sophisticated techniques, with particular attention paid to the relationships between civilian and military leadership. Our research has revealed significant patterns in how military experience affects coup risk across different types of governments.

The core analytical techniques include:
- Complementary log-log transformation for handling rare events
- Population-weighted regional risk calculations
- Temporal weighting to emphasize recent observations
- Validation against historical coup attempts from 1975-2016

Key limitations addressed include:
- Rarity of coup events
- Regional contagion effects
- Complex interaction between structural and immediate triggers
- Varying data quality across different regions and time periods

## Findings
1. Demonstrated high predictive accuracy with one-third of coups occurring in countries within top 5% of risk predictions
2. Identified 11x higher coup probability in cases above 99th percentile of risk compared to average
3. Revealed 32.8-fold increase in coup likelihood for cases above 99.9th percentile
4. Confirmed significant role of civilian-military dynamics in coup probability
5. Validated importance of electoral timing in coup risk assessment, as demonstrated in our analysis of Mali during 2021-2022

### IMPACT and FUTURE WORK
## Broader Implications
CoupCast's success has significant implications for both theoretical understanding and practical applications in political stability analysis. The project demonstrates the viability of machine learning approaches for complex political forecasting and provides a framework for similar applications in other areas of political risk assessment.

The system's ability to process complex political, economic, and social factors makes it an invaluable tool for policymakers, researchers, and security analysts. Its demonstrated success in real-world predictions, such as the Mali case, validates the approach and suggests potential applications in crisis prevention and response planning.

## Future Research Directions
Future research will focus on expanding the system's capabilities through the integration of additional data sources, including social media indicators, economic real-time data, and more detailed regional analysis capabilities. Model enhancements will emphasize the expansion of civilian-military collaboration patterns analysis, development of more sophisticated regional contagion models, and integration of natural language processing for media analysis. The project also aims to extend its practical applications through the development of country-specific risk assessment tools, creation of interactive visualization platforms, and implementation of real-time update capabilities.
