    SpaceNav is one of two projects I worked on with Brian Smith at Columbia University.
    For this project, we investigated how investigating how spatial interactions
    could be integrated within screen readers to improve the experience for blind and low-vision (BLV) users.
    While mobile screen readers have evolved to offer rich spatial interactions through touchscreens,
    desktop screen readers have remained relatively unchanged in presenting spatial information and are in need of
    rich, seamless mechanisms to be plugged into its existing assistive technology paradigms.

**Spatial Foundations**

Desktop screen readers face significant limitations in conveying spatial relationships compared to their mobile counterparts. While mobile users can explore layouts through touch, desktop screen readers are restricted to linear navigation methods, with inconsistent directional controls across different tools that make it difficult for users to understand how elements relate to each other spatially.

Though research has shown the importance of spatial understanding for blind and low-vision users, existing solutions like tactile sheets, 3D prints, and hardware-based approaches often require additional equipment. SpaceNav aims to bridge this gap by developing new ways for desktop screen readers to communicate spatial information through innovative input and output methods within existing workflows.

**The SpaceNav System**

SpaceNav reimagines how screen readers can convey spatial information through two key configurations:

1. **SpaceNav-Input**: A navigation system that empowers users to explore spatial web content intuitively through keyboard controls, eliminating the need for additional hardware while matching the natural exploration capabilities found in mobile screen readers.
2. **SpeaceNav-Output**: The system creates an immersive audio experience by dynamically varying pitch based on elements' vertical positions, using stereo panning to indicate horizontal locations, and providing distinct audio cues during scrolling movement enabling users to build accurate mental maps of webpage layouts.

**Technical Implementation**

The system leverages the Web Audio API for spatial audio effects alongside HTML, CSS, and TypeScript for its interface, using custom audio processing to calculate element positions relative to screen dimensions. It represents vertical placement through both variable pitch and spatial positioning, with higher elements producing higher-pitched audio, while ensuring all features function with standard stereo headphones to enable wide accessibility without requiring specialized hardware.
