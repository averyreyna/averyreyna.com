SpaceNav is one of two projects I worked on with Brian Smith at Columbia University, where we tackled an intriguing challenge: how could we bring spatial awareness to screen readers for blind and low-vision (BLV) users? While mobile screen readers have evolved to leverage touchscreens for rich spatial interactions, desktop screen readers have remained surprisingly static in how they convey spatial information. Our research revealed an exciting opportunity—we could enhance existing screen readers with sophisticated spatial capabilities without requiring users to purchase additional hardware. Through our work, we demonstrated how seamlessly spatial interactions could be woven into existing assistive technology frameworks, opening new possibilities for how BLV users navigate their digital world.

### RESEARCH CONTEXT
## Background
Personal computer screen readers and mobile screen readers offer fundamentally different experiences for users due to their hardware differences. Mobile devices feature touchscreens that allow users to explore content spatially–for instance, iOS's VoiceOver enables users to touch different parts of the screen to hear where interface elements are located. In stark contrast, desktop screen readers present information in a strictly linear fashion that makes it difficult to understand spatial layouts. The disparity extends to basic navigation methods. Desktop screen readers handle arrow keys inconsistently, macOS's VoiceOver uses only left and right arrow keys in Reading mode, while NVDA on Windows uses only up and down arrows for line-by-line navigation. This lack of standardization makes it challenging for users to build mental models of spatial relationships between elements. While prior research has explored various solutions including tactile sheets, 3D printed objects, and refreshable displays, most efforts required additional hardware setups. This left a significant gap in solutions that could enhance spatial understanding within existing desktop screen reader workflows without requiring extra equipment.

## Questions
1. How do we determine the benefits, drawbacks, and future potential for spatial interactions integrated into desktop screen readers, without adding hardware or creating new paradigms?
2. How can we understand user attitudes toward spatial input and output, particularly in the context of applications that mimic real-world websites?

### METHODOLOGY
## Research Design
The research employed a mixed-methods approach centered around SpaceNav, a custom screen reader system with two key configurations. SpaceNav-Input repurposes the four arrow keys for directional navigation while retaining traditional Tab and Shift+Tab navigation. SpaceNav-Output extends this by incorporating spatialized audio output, rendering all screen reader speech from a point sound source located at the element's 2D position on screen. In terms of design decisions, they were driven by the goal of keeping users familiar with screen reader paradigms while introducing spatial awareness without requiring additional hardware. This meant carefully considering how to integrate new features without disrupting existing workflows that users rely on.

## Implementation
The technical implementation leveraged the Web Audio API for spatial audio effects, with HTML, CSS, and TypeScript forming the foundation of the web interface. The system uses custom audio processing to calculate element positions, with modified pitch indicating vertical positioning—higher-pitched audio signaling elements higher on the page.

Two test applications were developed: a news website for content consumption and an "About Me" page creator for content production. The implementation calculated positions using element midpoints divided by screen dimensions, employed stereo audio for left-right positioning, and maintained compatibility with existing screen reader paradigms. This approach allowed for seamless integration of both directional and traditional navigation methods.

### DISCUSSION
## Data Analysis
The research team employed thematic coding and a grounded theory approach to analyze the qualitative data gathered from user sessions. This included careful examination of user feedback, think-aloud protocols, and comparative analysis of user performance with different configurations. The analysis particularly focused on how participants adapted to the spatial features and integrated them into their existing mental models of web navigation. The study faced several limitations, including the remote format necessitated by participant location and the constraint of working only with custom web applications. Additionally, the current implementation didn't support scrolling or complex layouts, which would be necessary for real-world application.

## Findings
1. **Navigation Preferences**: All participants preferred arrow key navigation over traditional methods, suggesting that directional control aligned better with users' spatial understanding of web layouts.
2. **Experience-Based Differences**: A notable pattern emerged between lifelong screen reader users and later adopters. Lifelong users had developed sophisticated mental models that sometimes made spatial audio features feel superfluous, while later adopters found them particularly helpful.
3. **Communication Enhancement**: The spatial interface significantly improved communication between BLV and sighted users, especially when discussing page layouts and element positioning.
4. **Cognitive Load Impact**: Most participants reported reduced cognitive load with SpaceNav-Output, though some experienced users found the additional audio information overwhelming.

### IMPACT AND FUTURE WORK
## Broader Implications
This research demonstrates the potential for integrating spatial awareness into existing screen reader paradigms without requiring additional hardware. The findings suggest that the gap between mobile and desktop screen reader experiences can be bridged through thoughtful integration of spatial features, potentially transforming how BLV users interact with web content on desktop platforms.

## Future Research Directions
The research team is currently developing SpaceNav-Chrome, a browser extension that will bring spatial audio screen reading to any website. This next phase will address key limitations identified in the study, including support for scrolling detection with audio feedback and handling of more non-grid layouts.

Future work will also explore the intriguing difference in spatial interaction preferences between lifelong screen reader users and later adopters, potentially leading to more personalized accessibility solutions. The team also sees potential for expanding the technology into educational tools and gaming interfaces, creating more immersive and inclusive digital experiences.
