SpaceNav is one of two projects I worked on with Brian Smith at Columbia University, which addresses the gap between mobile and desktop screen readers for blind and low-vision (BLV) users by introducing spatial awareness into the desktop experience. While mobile screen readers leverage touchscreens for spatial interactions, desktop versions remain predominantly linear. Through our custom screen reader system with two configurations—directional arrow navigation and spatialized audio output—we demonstrate how spatial interactions can be integrated without additional hardware requirements, enhancing how BLV users understand and navigate digital interfaces.

## Research Context
Due to hardware differences, desktop screen readers present a fundamentally different experience than their mobile counterparts. Mobile devices feature touchscreens that allow users to explore content spatially. For instance, iOS's VoiceOver lets users touch various screen parts to hear where interface elements are located. In stark contrast, desktop screen readers present information strictly linearly, making it difficult to understand spatial layouts. The disparity extends to basic navigation methods: desktop screen readers handle arrow keys inconsistently, with macOS's VoiceOver using only left and right arrow keys in Reading mode. In contrast, NVDA on Windows uses only up and down arrows for line-by-line navigation. This lack of standardization makes it challenging for users to build mental models of spatial relationships between elements.

While prior research has explored various solutions, including tactile sheets, 3D-printed objects, and refreshable displays, most efforts required additional hardware setups. This left a significant gap in solutions that could enhance spatial understanding within existing desktop screen reader workflows without requiring extra equipment. Our research explores how spatial interactions can seamlessly integrate into desktop screen readers, potentially transforming how BLV users interact with web content while working within familiar assistive technology frameworks.

## Methodology and Design
Our research employed a mixed-methods approach centered around SpaceNav, a custom screen reader system with two key configurations. SpaceNav-Input repurposes the four arrow keys for directional navigation while retaining traditional Tab and Shift+Tab navigation. SpaceNav-Output extends this by incorporating spatialized audio output, rendering all screen reader speech from a point sound source at the element's 2D position on the screen. These design decisions were driven by keeping users familiar with screen reader paradigms, introducing spatial awareness without requiring additional hardware, and carefully integrating new features without disrupting existing workflows.

The technical implementation leveraged the Web Audio API for spatial audio effects, with HTML, CSS, and TypeScript forming the foundation of the web interface. The system uses custom audio processing to calculate element positions, with modified pitch indicating vertical positioning—higher-pitched audio signals elements higher on the page. Two test applications were developed: a news website for content consumption and an "About Me" page creator for content production, allowing us to evaluate both content consumption and creation tasks.

## Research Questions
- How do we determine the benefits, drawbacks, and future potential for spatial interactions integrated into desktop screen readers, without adding hardware or creating new paradigms?
- How can we understand user attitudes toward spatial input and output, particularly in the context of applications that mimic real-world websites?

## Key Findings
Our research revealed significant insights into how BLV users interact with spatial interfaces. Most notably, all participants preferred arrow key navigation over traditional methods, suggesting that directional control aligned better with users' spatial understanding of web layouts. We also discovered a fascinating pattern between lifelong screen reader users and later adopters—lifelong users had developed sophisticated mental models that sometimes made spatial audio features feel superfluous. In contrast, later adopters found these features helpful for understanding page layouts. This difference highlights the impact of experience on technology adaptation and suggests the potential for personalized accessibility solutions based on user background.

The spatial interface significantly improved communication between BLV and sighted users, especially when discussing page layouts and element positioning—a critical finding for collaborative work environments. Regarding cognitive load, most participants reported reduced mental effort with SpaceNav-Output, though some experienced users found the additional audio information overwhelming, indicating a need for customizable interfaces. These findings demonstrate that spatial features can be successfully integrated into desktop screen readers without disrupting established workflows, potentially bridging the experience gap between mobile and desktop platforms for BLV users.

## Design Implications
Our findings demonstrate that spatial interaction capabilities can be successfully integrated into desktop screen readers without requiring additional hardware or completely reimagining the screen reader paradigm. All participants' preference for directional arrow navigation suggests that screen reader developers should consider standardizing and enhancing directional controls. The differences between lifelong users and later adopters indicate that accessibility solutions may benefit from adaptive approaches tailored to users' experience levels and mental models. Additionally, the improved communication between BLV and sighted users highlights the potential for spatial interfaces to bridge collaborative environments, promoting more inclusive digital workspaces.

## Limitations and Future Work
The study faced several limitations, including the remote format necessitated by participant location and the constraint of working only with custom web applications. The current implementation doesn't support scrolling or complex layouts, which would be necessary for real-world applications. Our team is developing SpaceNav-Chrome, a browser extension that will bring spatial audio screen reading to any website to address these limitations. This next phase will address key constraints identified in the study, including support for scrolling detection with audio feedback and handling of more non-grid layouts. Future work will also explore the intriguing difference in spatial interaction preferences between lifelong screen reader users and later adopters, potentially leading to more personalized accessibility solutions based on user experience levels.

## Broader Impact
This research demonstrates the potential for integrating spatial awareness into existing screen reader paradigms without requiring additional hardware. The findings suggest that the gap between mobile and desktop screen reader experiences can be bridged through thoughtful integration of spatial features, potentially transforming how BLV users interact with web content. By enhancing spatial understanding, these innovations may significantly improve the accessibility of complex interfaces like maps, diagrams, and data visualizations that have traditionally been challenging for screen reader users. Beyond web browsing, the principles demonstrated in this research could extend to educational applications, gaming interfaces, and productivity tools, creating more immersive and inclusive digital experiences across multiple domains.
