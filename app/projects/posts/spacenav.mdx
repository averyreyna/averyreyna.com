SpaceNav is one of two projects I developed with Brian Smith at Columbia University, investigating how spatial interactions could be integrated within screen readers to improve the experience for blind and low-vision (BLV) users. This work was published in ASSETS '23 and revealed what rich, seamless mechanisms can be plugged into existing assistive technology paradigms. We explored how we can make desktop screen readers more spatially aware without requiring additional hardware. While mobile screen readers have evolved to offer rich spatial interactions through touchscreens, desktop screen readers have remained relatively unchanged in presenting spatial information.

## What's the Challenge?

For many BLV users, desktop screen readers are still the primary tool for navigating the web. While mobile screen readers like iOS's VoiceOver have evolved to allow users to explore content spatially through touchscreens, desktop screen readers remain limited in presenting spatial information. They present content in a strictly linear fashion, making it difficult to understand the spatial layout of websites. This creates a disconnect between how sighted users experience web content and how it's presented through screen readers.

The challenge is particularly evident in how desktop screen readers handle directional navigation. For instance, macOS's VoiceOver uses only left and right arrow keys in Reading mode, while NVDA uses only up and down arrows for line-by-line navigation. This inconsistency makes it hard for users to build a mental model of spatial relationships between elements, as there's no standard for directional navigation.

## Spatial Foundations

The contrast between desktop and mobile screen reader experiences highlights a significant gap in spatial awareness capabilities. While mobile screen readers have evolved to leverage touchscreens, allowing users to explore spatial layouts by touching different parts of the screen, desktop screen readers remain constrained to linear presentation methods. This limitation is particularly evident in how different desktop screen readers handle directional navigation - some use only left and right arrow keys for reading. In contrast, others restrict navigation to up and down arrows for line-by-line movement. This inconsistency makes it challenging for users to develop an understanding of spatial relationships between elements on a page.

Accessibility research has consistently demonstrated the importance of providing spatial and immersive ways for BLV users to understand visual content. Previous approaches have explored various solutions, including tactile sheets, 3D printed objects, and refreshable displays to help users explore educational content, artwork, and graphics. For web content specifically, while some solutions have investigated hardware-based approaches or alternative methods like concurrent spatial sounds and cursor position audio cues, most efforts have required additional hardware setups. This has left a gap in solutions that could enhance spatial understanding within existing desktop screen reader workflows without needing extra equipment. SpaceNav addresses this gap by reimagining how screen readers can convey spatial information through innovative input and output configurations.

## The SpaceNav System

SpaceNav reimagines how screen readers can convey spatial information through two key configurations. The first is SpaceNav-Input, which gives users a spatial compass for navigation. Users can navigate content directionally using arrow keys instead of being limited to Tab and Shift+Tab navigation while maintaining traditional navigation methods when preferred. This allows users to move through content in a way that matches their mental model of the page layout.

The second configuration, SpaceNav-Output, adds an extra layer of spatial awareness through audio. Screen reader speech comes from the actual 2D position of elements on the page, with higher-pitched audio indicating elements higher on the page. Using stereo headphones, users experience a natural sense of left-right positioning, and unique audio cues alert them when elements move during scrolling.

## Technical Implementation

The system uses the Web Audio API for spatial audio effects and HTML, CSS, and TypeScript for the web interface. For SpaceNav-Output, we developed custom audio processing that calculates the midpoint position of each element and divides it by the screen's width/height for x/y positioning, respectively. We added changes in pitch as a redundant cue for representing the vertical position, with higher-pitched speech indicating elements higher on the page. This provides users with multiple ways to understand an element's position. All of this is achieved without requiring additional hardware beyond standard stereo headphones, making the system accessible to anyone with a standard computer setup. This was a deliberate design choice to ensure the technology could be widely adopted without creating additional barriers to access.

## User Study

To evaluate SpaceNav, we designed a comprehensive study that put users in content consumption and creation scenarios. Each participant experienced both configurations of our system while navigating through two different layouts of a custom news website. They then used SpaceNav to create their own "About Me" page, which gave us insights into how spatial awareness affects content creation tasks.

The study involved nine BLV participants, aged 22 to 65, who were either regular screen reader users or highly familiar with them. Throughout the sessions, participants were encouraged to think aloud, sharing their reactions to the system and their interpretations of spatial relationships between elements. The remote study sessions, conducted over Zoom, typically lasted two hours, giving participants ample time to explore the system thoroughly and provide detailed feedback.

## Research Insights

Our study revealed fascinating patterns in how participants interacted with spatial information. All nine participants preferred using the arrow keys as their input mechanism instead of Tab and Shift+Tab in both SpaceNav configurations. Many users experienced reduced cognitive load and gained a better understanding of website layouts. They particularly valued how the system improved communication with sighted users about page organization. SpaceNav-Output proved especially valuable for both content consumption and production scenarios. One participant noted how they really liked the spatial audio, which helped build a mental picture of where things actually are located. Participants also expressed increased independence from feeling more immersed in and aware of page layouts. The system helped them orient themselves without relying on memory, counting, or understanding coordinates.

However, we also encountered various challenges. Interestingly, many longtime screen reader users had already developed sophisticated mental models for navigation, making the spatial audio features feel superfluous to them. This pattern exposed a notable difference in preferences between lifelong screen reader users and those who adopted the technology later in life. Integration posed another hurdle, as participants expressed concern about how the new controls would mesh with existing screen reader commands. Additionally, some users worried that directional navigation might compromise their ability to understand content through categorical groupings. These findings underscored a crucial principle in assistive technology design: the delicate balance between introducing innovative features while preserving familiar interaction patterns.

## Applications Beyond Web Browsing

The potential applications of SpaceNav extend far beyond basic web browsing. In education, it could help explain complex computer science concepts like binary trees by providing spatial context. For gaming, it offers new possibilities for creating more immersive experiences for BLV players. The system could also transform how presentations are delivered to mixed audiences of sighted and BLV users, creating a more inclusive knowledge-sharing environment. In workplace settings, SpaceNav's spatial awareness features could improve collaboration by providing a shared understanding of visual layouts between sighted and BLV team members.

## Future Directions

Upon my departure, the team was developing SpaceNav-Chrome, a browser extension that will bring spatial audio screen reading to any website. This next step will work with popular sites like Google, CNN, and Reddit, incorporating intelligent scrolling detection with audio feedback while maintaining compatibility with existing screen reader functions. The extension aims to address some of the limitations identified in our study, such as handling multi-page websites that involve scrolling and supporting more non-grid layouts.
