I studied electoral disctricting through the lens of computational topology with Jim Thatcher during my time at the University of Washington. As districts are drawn and redrawn, a key challenge lies in identifying and preserving "communities of interest" or groups of people who share common social, economic, cultural, or other characteristics that suggest they should be represented together. The challenge is acute in areas with complex demographic patterns, where traditional geographic boundaries may not align with community boundaries. We explored a novel approach to detecting these communities using topological data analysis, specifically through an algorithm called Mapper.

## Research Context
The challenge of identifying and preserving "communities of interest" has become increasingly central to electoral districting, with twenty-seven states now including these communities in their criteria for drawing district lines. While communities of interest are generally understood as contiguous populations sharing common social and economic characteristics that warrant unified representation, identifying these communities poses significant challenges. Traditional approaches rely heavily on geographic proximity or simple demographic overlays, potentially missing critical socioeconomic patterns that cross spatial boundaries and failing to capture the complex ways communities form beyond geographic contiguity.

Previous approaches to this challenge have utilized various methods with limited success. Geographic information systems have been used extensively to analyze spatial patterns in demographic data but struggle to capture non-spatial relationships. Social network analysis has offered insights into community formation but faces challenges in application to districting due to data privacy concerns and scale limitations. Recent work in computational topology has shown promise in analyzing voting patterns and detecting gerrymandering through techniques like persistent homology. Still, the specific application of topological data analysis to community identification in districting remains relatively unexplored. This research fills that gap by investigating how topological data analysis, specifically the Mapper algorithm, can detect meaningful communities that traditional methods might overlook.

## Methodology and Design
We focused our analysis on Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, a region with significant demographic complexity and a rich history of redistricting challenges. The analysis drew from American Community Survey data at the census block group level, focusing on 11 key socioeconomic variables, including educational attainment, employment, SNAP enrollment, language proficiency, income levels, housing tenure, racial composition, and rural/urban classification.

Implementing Mapper required careful consideration of several parameters that significantly affected the results. We employed truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD) to reduce data dimensionality while preserving key relationships and tested various parameter combinations to assess stability. Our methodology included 50% overlap between cover elements, experimentation with different numbers of intervals (3-9) in the cover, and single linkage clustering for node formation. We conducted a rigorous stability analysis to determine how much the results changed with slight parameter adjustments. This revealed that nodes remained relatively consistent across small changes in overlap parameters, mainly when using TSVD with two components. We also standardized our data to prevent variables with more significant variances from dominating the analysis, which shifted emphasis toward variables like educational attainment and SNAP enrollment.

## Research Questions
- Can topological data analysis, specifically the Mapper algorithm, detect meaningful communities of interest that traditional clustering methods might miss?
- How stable are the communities identified through Mapper across different parameter settings?
- How do communities identified through topological analysis relate to geographic districts in practice?
- What are the implications of non-contiguous communities of interest for electoral districting?

## Key Findings
Our analysis revealed three distinct community clusters that consistently appeared across multiple parameter settings, suggesting we had identified genuinely distinct communities rather than artifacts of our methodology. The first cluster comprised 135 block groups with roughly 226,000 residents, with higher proportions of SNAP enrollment, lower income levels, and lower educational attainment than county averages. Although relatively contiguous geographically, this community was split across multiple districts in the 2011 and 2019 districting plans, potentially fragmenting their political representation.

The second cluster consisted of 36 block groups with approximately 84,000 residents, showing distinctive characteristics regarding English language proficiency and the presence of children. These communities appeared more dispersed throughout the county, raising essential questions about whether geographic dispersion should preclude consideration as a community of interest. The third cluster included 21 block groups (roughly 55,000 residents) characterized by high homeownership rates, white-collar employment, and the presence of children. While primarily located in suburban areas, this cluster appeared in distinct geographic groupings that challenged traditional notions of community contiguity.

Our investigation revealed that Singular Value Decomposition was crucial to Mapper's effectiveness, with the combination of dimensional reduction and hierarchical clustering providing insights into sub-communities that might be missed by either approach alone. When comparing Mapper's results with traditional hierarchical clustering, we found that Mapper successfully detected meaningful groupings that shared common characteristics despite spatial separation—a notable advantage stemming from its ability to allow overlapping communities and capture gradual transitions between different groups.

## Design Implications
The application of Mapper to electoral districting reveals several promising capabilities while highlighting significant implementation challenges. Its ability to detect subtle, overlapping community patterns provides a new lens for understanding social relationships and identifying historically marginalized communities that might otherwise be overlooked, moving beyond the rigid boundaries typical of traditional approaches. However, translating these insights into practical districting plans presents considerable difficulties—identified communities often show geographic dispersion that conflicts with legal contiguity requirements, frequently fail to align with practical constraints (being either too large or too small for district boundaries), and create tension with other crucial districting criteria like population equality and compactness. The most significant design challenge lies in developing approaches that can incorporate these nuanced community insights while satisfying the legal and practical requirements of electoral districting, potentially requiring more sophisticated methods that balance preserving social connections with geometric constraints.

## Limitations and Future Work
The historical context of Mecklenburg County presented both opportunities and challenges for our study. Charlotte's complex history of segregation and urban development created deeply entrenched patterns in its demographic landscape, making it an ideal case study for detecting marginalized communities. However, this history also complicates the interpretation of our results, as many patterns of inequality and separation are deeply embedded in the urban fabric, and distinguishing between meaningful communities and artifacts of historical discrimination requires careful consideration.

Future research should explore several promising directions. Alternative variable selection less directly tied to socioeconomic status could reveal different types of communities. Better integration of geographic constraints while preserving Mapper's ability to detect non-contiguous communities represents another critical area for development. Validation through qualitative research to verify whether detected communities align with residents' lived experiences would strengthen findings, particularly given the complex relationship between statistical patterns and community identity. Scaling the approach to larger geographic areas and different political contexts would test its broader applicability, though current implementations face computational challenges with larger datasets. Finally, exploring applications in more politically diverse regions could reveal more complex relationships between community detection and political representation than those found in predominantly Democratic urban areas.

## Broader Impact
This research expands our conception of what communities can be in the context of democratic representation. By revealing complex patterns of connection and overlap that transcend traditional geographic boundaries, it challenges fundamental assumptions about how communities should be preserved in the districting process. The tension between the organic formation of communities and the geometric requirements of electoral districts invites a more nuanced approach to keeping communities of interest—one that recognizes both the value of cohesive representation and the reality that meaningful social bonds often exist across conventional boundaries.

The methodological innovation demonstrated in this work has applications beyond electoral districting, offering new approaches to community detection in various domains where complex social patterns must be identified and understood. By bridging sophisticated mathematical techniques with practical policy challenges, this research contributes to a growing body of work that uses computational methods to address fundamental questions of democratic representation and social cohesion. Ultimately, it reminds us that the lines we draw on maps are approximations of more complex social realities—approximations that might be improved through approaches that embrace rather than simplify this complexity.
