Help Supporters is the second project I worked on with Brian Smith at Columbia University. It explores technological solutions that bridge the social gap between blind and low-vision (BLV) individuals and sighted strangers in public spaces. Using a mixed-ability research-through-design approach, we investigated four distinct prototypes addressing different aspects of face-to-face assistance interactions, uncovering key design principles that balance technological support with user autonomy.

## Research Context
BLV individuals frequently encounter challenges when navigating public environments and often require assistance from strangers. Despite many sighted people being willing to help (platforms like BeMyEyes have 13 times more sighted volunteers than blind users), such collaborations rarely occur due to significant social barriers. BLV individuals report anxiety about approaching strangers, while sighted people lack an understanding of BLV needs and proper interaction techniques. This research explores how assistive technology can serve as "Help Supporters" that facilitate connections and collaboration between BLV individuals and sighted strangers, addressing these social challenges rather than attempting purely technical solutions.

## Methodology and Design
Through a mixed-ability research-through-design process, we developed and evaluated four prototype approaches spanning two critical phases of help interactions. For the connection phase (finding someone to help), we created Person-Finder Glasses, a wearable device using computer vision to help BLV users locate nearby people, and Volunteer Platform, an app-based system matching BLV users with willing helpers in proximity. For the collaboration phase (facilitating practical help), we developed Pictorial Display, a wearable screen showing guidance to sighted helpers using fun, image-based prompts, and Vague Directions Flagger, a smartphone app that identifies the imprecise language in sighted helpers' instructions and suggests improvements. These prototypes were designed to explore different regions of the design space based on six key attributes, including privacy, information detail, and environmental coverage.

## Research Questions
- Should help supporters encourage BLV people to make face-to-face requests or app-based requests for help from nearby strangers?
- What information should help supporters give BLV and sighted people about each other for connection?
- What types of information should help supporters provide during help?
- Where should help supporters situate the information during help?

## Key Findings
Our research revealed that app-based platforms consistently outperformed face-to-face approaches in facilitating help interactions, with the Volunteer Platform notably reducing social pressure for both BLV and sighted participants. Pre-interaction information exchange proved highly valuable, particularly regarding helper experience levels with assisting visually impaired individuals. Safety emerged as a paramount concern throughout our study, with many BLV participants expressing clear preferences for specific helper demographics and appreciating the structured environment that technology-mediated connections provided compared to approaching strangers directly.

In the collaboration phase, real-time feedback mechanisms substantially improved communication quality between parties, though sighted helpers strongly preferred private correction over publicly visible guidance. Visual aids, especially the Bitmoji illustrations in the Pictorial Display, created a more relaxed atmosphere while effectively conveying guidance and fostering empathy. The assistance quality markedly improved when helpers received information that enhanced their understanding of BLV experiences, with several participants noting improved confidence in their ability to help effectively. These findings informed key design principles for future assistive technologies, particularly the importance of balancing automated assistance with BLV user autonomy and the strategic placement of information displays to maintain natural social interaction.

## Design Implications
The success of the platform-based approach indicates that technological interventions in social assistance should create structured environments for interaction while preserving user autonomy and dignity. This study emphasizes the importance of balancing technical and social aspects in assistive technology design. While tools like the Pictorial Display and Vague Directions Flagger supported sighted helpers in assisting, they also risked diminishing the voices of BLV individuals. Participants highlighted the need to maintain organic communication alongside technological support, suggesting that future designs should empower BLV users with greater control over when and how to help supporters intervene.

## Limitations and Future Work
Our research would benefit from a longitudinal study exploring how these tools function in diverse real-world environments. While our controlled research provided valuable insights, understanding how these technologies integrate into daily life and how they influence the formation of mixed-ability help-based communities requires longer-term observation. Future work should also explore how to better balance technological assistance with BLV user autonomy by developing mechanisms that let BLV users control when help supporters activate. Additionally, investigating how these technologies might support the development of lasting connections between BLV and sighted individuals could reveal opportunities for building more inclusive communities.

## Broader Impact
This research demonstrates how the interdependence framework can be applied to assistive technology design, creating solutions that do not merely bridge accessibility gaps for BLV individuals but reshape how mixed-ability collaboration occurs in public spaces. By emphasizing technologies that educate sighted individuals rather than placing the burden of adaptation solely on BLV people, this approach promotes a more inclusive society where accessibility becomes a shared responsibility. The findings contribute to theoretical understanding of collaborative accessibility and offer practical pathways for technology-mediated assistance that preserves dignity, agency, and social connection.
