    Help Supporters is the second project I worked on with Brian Smith at Columbia University.
    For this project, we explored how technology can bridge the social gap between blind
    people and sighted strangers who want to help them.

    _Consider how often you see a blind person getting help from a stranger in public. It's surprisingly rare, right?_

    Yet platforms like BeMyEyes have 13 times more sighted volunteers than blind users. This reveals a
    fascinating paradox: while many sighted people are eager to help, face-to-face assistance
    rarely happens due to complex social barriers affecting both parties. Our research
    investigates how thoughtfully designed technology could facilitate these interactions.

**Key Research Areas**

Our research explores four main aspects of public space assistance: social barriers, technological solutions, interaction design, and accessibility considerations.
</TwoCol>

<TwoCol>
**01. Social Barriers**

We identified several key social barriers that prevent face-to-face assistance between blind and sighted individuals in public spaces:

_Understanding these barriers is crucial for designing effective solutions._
</TwoCol>

<TwoCol>
**Key Findings**

**Approachability Concerns**: Both parties often hesitate to initiate contact due to uncertainty about social norms and fear of awkward interactions.

**Communication Gaps**: Sighted helpers may lack understanding of how to effectively assist blind individuals.

**Safety and Trust**: Blind individuals may have concerns about trusting strangers in public spaces.

**Social Stigma**: Both parties may worry about drawing unwanted attention or appearing incompetent.

**02. Technological Solutions**

Our research proposes several technological interventions to address these social barriers and facilitate public space assistance.
</TwoCol>

<TwoCol>
**Key Features:**

**Proximity Detection**: Using Bluetooth and GPS to identify potential helpers nearby.

**Trust Building**: Implementing a verification system for helpers with ratings and reviews.

**Communication Tools**: In-app guidance for effective assistance and communication.

**Safety Measures**: Emergency contacts and location sharing features.

**03. Interaction Design**

The design of our solution focuses on creating smooth, natural interactions between blind individuals and sighted helpers.
</TwoCol>

<TwoCol>
**Key Elements:**

**Simple Interface**: Clean, accessible design for both blind and sighted users.

**Clear Communication**: Built-in tools for expressing needs and offering help.

**Feedback System**: Ways for both parties to rate and improve interactions.

**Cultural Sensitivity**: Design that respects different cultural norms and practices.

**System Implementation**

Our prototype combines mobile app development with location-based services and accessibility features.

The system uses React Native for cross-platform compatibility, Firebase for backend services,
and various accessibility APIs for seamless integration with screen readers and other assistive technologies.

More details about the implementation can be found in our [published paper](link-to-paper).

**Looking Forward**

This research opens up new possibilities for using technology to bridge social gaps and facilitate meaningful human interactions. We're currently exploring partnerships with organizations and conducting further user studies to refine our approach.
